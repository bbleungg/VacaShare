## What is VacaShare? ##
  > VacaShare is an app that lets users share their vacation experiences with other users of the app. Looking to plan your next vacation in a certain country, but don't know what to do there? Use VacaShare to read reviews on about that place from other users! Mark reviews that you liked to save them for when you're planning a future getaway!

## What does VacaShare solve? ##
  > Sometimes it is difficult to research all the best places a vacation area may have to offer. So why not share with others and create the best vacation possible?

## How does VacaShare solve this? ##
  > As VacaShare grows, users will have access to many real-life reviews of places they want to vacation to: No more fake advertising of "must-dos"! All reviews are user-created! Favorite only the reviews you like, and you'll have an agenda set for your next trip there.

## Quote from the Maker ##
  > "I personally have the hardest time planning vacations: There are places I know I want to go to, but I never know what to visit over there! Searching the internet can only go so far, and I'm never sure if an advertised place is from honest opinion of users or a paid-advert by a company looking for business. So we made this app to make it a lot easier for me, and hopefully to the users of VacaShare."

## Quote from a Customer ##
  > "Before VacaShare, I felt like I always missed out going to new places. I would only go to the tourist-y places listed from the top of my search results, but I would miss out on all the smaller, less-known attractions of that place. VacaShare has really allowed me to find these awesome places, and I am always more than willing to share those places that I find when I'm vacation-ing!"
